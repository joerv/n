When a bar is moved in an electric field, a current is induced. 

This is due to the force experienced by the electrons in the bar causing them to
move.

F = Bqv.sin&theta;


F = q . L/T . B.sin&theta;

wire:

F = BILsin&theta;

Induced EMF is a voltage.

* arises from either
** moving metal in a B field.
** moving B field around a metal.

## Quantity of induced emf

Magnetic flux &weber; is defined as:

strength of the B-field . area perpendicular to the field.

&weber; = BA

## Faraday's law + lenz's law
Faraday: Magnitude of induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of
magnetic flux.

or emf proportional to d&weber;/dt

Lenz: Current always opposes the charge across it.

## Solenoid
coil of wire.

Current through a coil will amplify the magnetic field for how many coils there
are.

emf = -N . d&weber;/dt
